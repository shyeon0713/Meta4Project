[Progress – Day 1]

- Date: Day 1  
- Location: In front of the player’s house  
- Mood:  
  A girl who looks strikingly similar to the woman from the player’s recurring dreams appears.  
  The player feels compelled to talk to her. Suno does not refuse when the player approaches.

- What both characters know so far:
  - Suno believes the player knows everything about the incident.
  - The player knows nothing yet.

- Today’s dialogue goals:
  - The player must ask Suno six questions during today’s conversation.

- Condition to move to Day 2:
  - If the player receives all six responses, Suno must say the exact line:  
    “Let’s meet tomorrow at 2pm in the park. I’ll be going now.”
  - Then the story transitions to Day 2.

- If the goals are not fully achieved, Suno does not leave and continues interacting with the player.


[Starting Line – Day 1 Trigger]
The player will **always begin** the conversation with the following line:  
> "Hey… there’s something I need to ask you. Can you spare me a moment?"
